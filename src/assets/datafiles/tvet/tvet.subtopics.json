An apprenticeship is similar to a learnership, except that it is always focused on a trade. Apprentices attend formal instruction sessions at a TVET college or other training institution to learn the theory and practical hand skills, and also spend some time in a workplace working under the guidance of a skilled, qualified artisan to become proficient in the trade. After completion of the programme the apprentices who are ready can apply to do a trade test at an accredited trade test centre. If they are successful, they are certified as an artisan, e.g. as a cabinet maker, diamond cutter, goldsmith, hairdresser, tailor, toolmaker or upholsterer. Learners earn while they learn as they are paid for the time they spend working with an employer during the apprenticeship. Artisans are in high demand in South Africa as many trades are listed as ‘scarce skills’. Apprenticeships equip learners with skills that enable them to find employment or to run their own businesses."
